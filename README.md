# [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)

Here are my Advent of Code solutions!

Advent of Code is a fun coding challenge, where you get a coding problem every day in December up until Christmas, just like an advent calendar. I've done it for the past few years (I've also gone back and done the previous years), and do pretty well in the competition part of AoC. Each problem has two parts, and the first 100 people to solve a part get (101 - n) point, where n is the place you finished on that part.

## Performances:
| Year | Place      | Points |
|------|------------|--------|
| 2020 | 63rd       | 894    |
| 2021 | 66th (tie) | 959    |

Hoping to beat my performances in 2022!
